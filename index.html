                        <p>AAWS EC2 Instance is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to offer computing
                            capacity
                            in
                            the form of a virtual
                            server that can be configured by users. In an AWS EC2 Instance project, users can create,
                            configure,
                            and manage EC2
                            instances to run applications, perform computing tasks, or store and process data.</p>

                        <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
                        <p>The data visualization project aimed to transform complex data into an easily accessible and
                            understandable format. Our
                            team utilized a variety of visualization tools and techniques to create compelling and
                            informative
                            graphics. The project
                            began with identifying the key data points and metrics that would be the focus of the
                            visualizations. We then worked to
                            choose the best visualization types for each dataset, whether that be bar charts, line
                            graphs,
                            scatter plots, or other
                            forms. The colors and fonts were also carefully selected to ensure the graphics were
                            aesthetically
                            pleasing and easy to
                            read. Finally, we added explanatory labels and annotations to provide context and help the
                            viewer
                            interpret the data.
                            Overall, the data visualization project was a success, providing stakeholders with a clear
                            understanding of complex data
                            and allowing for better decision making.</p>

                            program also emphasizes the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and
                            communication
                            skills. Participants
                            work on real-world data science projects throughout the program, which provides them with
                            practical
                            experience and a
                            portfolio of work to showcase their skills to potential employers. Upon completion of the
                            program,
                            participants receive
